sdl2-font
=========

I'm trying to get stb_truetype.h to work with SDL2.

I started with the following article:

    http://eatenbyagrue.org/using_stb_truetype_with_sdl.html

Note: stb_truetype.h doesn't seem to work with .otf files.
When I discovered this, I decided to hold off on further work
on this project.
